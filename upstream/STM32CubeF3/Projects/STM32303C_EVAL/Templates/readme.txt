@par Example Description

This projects provides a reference template that can be used to build any firmware application.

This project can be used for STM32F303VC devices using STM32CubeF3 HAL and running on STM32303C-EVAL board
from STMicroelectronics. 

@note Care must be taken when using HAL_Delay(), this function provides accurate delay (in milliseconds)
      based on variable incremented in SysTick ISR. This implies that if HAL_Delay() is called from
      a peripheral ISR process, then the SysTick interrupt must have higher priority (numerically lower)
      than the peripheral interrupt. Otherwise the caller ISR process will be blocked.
      To change the SysTick interrupt priority you have to use HAL_NVIC_SetPriority() function.
      
@note The application need to ensure that the SysTick time base is always set to 1 millisecond
      to have correct HAL operation.

@par Hardware and Software environment  

  - This example runs on STM32F303VC devices.
    
  - This example has been tested with STMicroelectronics STM32303C-EVAL RevC
    boards and can be easily tailored to any other supported device 
    and development board.


@par How to use it ? 

In order to make the program work, you must do the following :
 - Open your preferred toolchain 
 - Rebuild all files and load your image into target memory
 - Run the example
