@par Example Description

How to configure the IWDG peripheral to ensure periodical counter update and 
generate an MCU IWDG reset when a user button is pressed. The peripheral 
is initialized with LL unitary service functions to optimize 
for performance and size.

Example Configuration:
Configure the IWDG (prescaler, counter) and enable it.
Infinite refresh of the IWDG down-counter done in the main loop.
Led is blinking fast & continuously

Example Execution:
When User Button is pressed, the down-counter automatic refresh mechanism is 
disable and thus, reset will occur. After a reset, when re-entering in the main, 
RCC IWDG Reset Flag will be checked and if we are back from a IWDG reset the led
will be switch ON.

Waiting a new user button pressed to re-activate the IWDG
