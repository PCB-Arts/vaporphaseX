## Vapor Phase One

Vapor Phase One brings the industry's most flexible PCB soldering process to hobbyists and development engineers alike. In contrast to infrared and convection soldering, the vapor phase process excels at handling high thermal mass assemblies. Large SMD capacitors, high-power inductors, and even metal substrate PCBs are no challenge for the Vapor Phase One, which can also solder fine-pitch structures and heat-sensitive components without risk. Finally, its homogenous temperature distribution minimizes warp and bow of the PCB, which decreases internal stresses on the assembly.

## Features

- **Fast temperature profiles**: The design of Vapor Phase One allows
  the user to run fast temperature profiles by means of a
  height-adjustable PCB carrier. The assembly is placed on an open
  wire mesh, some distance above the heat-transfer medium, as
  determined by a fast temperature control loop.

- **Individual soldering profiles**: Vapor Phase One can import
  individual soldering profiles through a USB interface or from an SD
  card. It uses these profiles to adjust heating power and lift
  position to account for different solder pastes and PCB
  technologies.

- **Conservation of heat-transfer medium**: After a soldering process
  is completed, the entire capacity of Vapor Phase One's cooling
  circuit—plus four additional fans mounted to its base—can be used to
  cool the process chamber as quickly as possible. This optional
  "Quick Cool" feature reduces the process time and ensures a minimum
  loss of Galden when the board is removed.

- **Lid lift**: The lid to the process chamber lifts automatically to
  facilitate the insertion and removal of a PCB. This safety feature
  also contributes to the preservation of heat-transfer medium.

- **Viewing window**: In addition to a screen that displays realtime
  temperature data, Vapor Phase One provides a viewing window,
  complete with internal lighting, that allows you to see inside the
  process chamber.
